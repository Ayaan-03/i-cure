                    <h5>For Software for which an Update Service is available, the License shall include:</h5>
                    <p>A non-exclusive, non-transferable (with the exception of clause 5. below) right to use the
                        Software
                        without added charge for the License Term, and A right to access the Update Service during the

                    <p>For Managed Services and Software for which no Update Service is provided, the License shall
                        include
                        a non-exclusive, non-transferable (with the exception of clause 5. below) right to use the
                        Managed
                        Services or the Software during the License Term as paid for.</p>

                        rights,
                        shall be retained by ADEEVA TECHNOLOGIES PVT .LTD Apps.</p>

                    <p>After an agreement has been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated, the Customer's License for the
                        Products or Services shall automatically terminate and Customer shall have no further right of
                        Access to or use of the Product or Services. The Customer shall receive no further
                        Updates/Upgrades

                        copies
                        and the Software data files stored on its Computer system. ADEEVA TECHNOLOGIES PVT .LTD Apps may demand a written
                        confirmation by the Customer declaring that all Software has been deleted in full.</p>

                    <p>Software has a specific product lifecycle that governs the operating systems with which the
                        Software
                        is compatible and how long the Software will be supported by ADEEVA TECHNOLOGIES PVT .LTD Apps. Software is possibly
                        not compatible with operating systems that are not specified in the product lifecycle or once
                        the
                        support period has expired. Therefore, the product lifecycle constitutes therefore an integral
                        part
                        of the relevant agreement and is published on www.oqsolution.in.</p>

                    <h5>Provisions for the use of Software and Managed Service:</h5>
                    <p>In using the Software and/or Managed Service, the Customer shall at all times comply with these
                        Terms
                        and Conditions as well as the terms of the EULA and/or SLA applicable at the time of execution
                        of
                        this agreement. In particular, the Software must not be reproduced, transferred or decompiled
                        (i.e.
                        recompilation into the source code), unless expressly permitted by the EULA or permitted
                        according
                        to law. If the Customer wishes to reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the Software
                        (hereinafter referred to as "De-compilation") for the purpose of achieving interoperability with
                        other computer programs if allowed by law, the Customer shall contact ADEEVA TECHNOLOGIES PVT .LTD Apps before
                        De-compilation of the Software and request the provision of the information necessary for the
                        achievement of such interoperability. If ADEEVA TECHNOLOGIES PVT .LTD Apps supplies such information concerning
                        interoperability without undue delay, the Customer shall not be entitled to decompile the
                        Software.
                        Software for which no special Licenses for Multiple Use are available according to the relevant
                        product information is restricted to use on one Computer by a Customer. For this purpose, the
                        Customer may use any available Computer that meets the system requirements and for which the
                        License
                        was granted. Should the Customer change the Computer, the Software must be deleted from the
                        Computer
                        on which the Software was previously installed before the reinstallation of the Software on a
                        different Computer. For Software whose product information provides special Licenses for
                        Multiple
                        Use, Multiple Use shall be permissible only if, and to the extent that, the Customer purchased
                        and
                        was granted the relevant type or number of Licenses by ADEEVA TECHNOLOGIES PVT .LTD Apps.

                    </p>
                    <p>Unless explicitly granted in the applicable License, Customer shall not have the right to access
                        Managed Services by simultaneous or multiple use of the same Login. ADEEVA TECHNOLOGIES PVT .LTD Apps reserves all
                        rights to bring an action to prohibit or stop any unauthorized use of Products and/or Services
                        by
                        the Customer, including but not limited to, claims for injunctive relief and damages.
                        Unauthorized
                        use by the Customer may lead to criminal prosecution under the relevant laws. Reference is also
                        made

                        of this clause by Reseller are difficult to determine and/or quantify. Therefore, for each

                        provisions remain unaffected. Such liquidated damages will be set off against any other damage
                        awards to ADEEVA TECHNOLOGIES PVT .LTD Apps resulting from the breach.</p>
