              understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and
              how we will treat it.
            </p>
  
            <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>

              that can be used to identify you, such as your name, email address,
              phone number, or other contact information. We may collect this
              information when you register or use the App.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Device Information:</strong> We may collect information

              unique device identifiers, IP address, and mobile network
              information.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Location Information:</strong> If you permit the App to
              access location services, we may collect information about your
              precise or approximate location. You can manage location permissions
              in your device settings.
            </p>
  
            <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
            <p>
              We use the information we collect, including location and IMEI data,
              for various purposes to enhance your experience with our App. Below
              is a detailed explanation of how we use this data:
            </p>
  
            <h3>2.1 Location Data</h3>
            <p><strong>Collection and Purpose:</strong></p>
            <p>
              <strong>Tracking and Recovery:</strong> Location data is collected
              to help track and recover your device if it is lost or stolen, or to
              track other devices associated with your account. This information
              is collected when the app is uninstalled or upon request for
              customer tracking purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>User Consent:</strong> We collect location data only with
              your explicit consent, which you provide when you install or use the
              app. You can manage or revoke this permission at any time through
              your device settings.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Security Measures:</strong></p>
            <p>
              <strong>Data Protection:</strong> Location data is securely stored
              on Google Cloud with encryption and restricted access to ensure it
              is protected from unauthorized access or disclosure.
            </p>
  
            <h3>2.2 IMEI Number</h3>
            <p><strong>Collection and Purpose:</strong></p>
            <p>
              <strong>Verification:</strong> The IMEI number is used as an
              additional verification layer for users with multiple devices. This
              helps ensure secure access and manage devices linked to your
              account.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>User Consent:</strong> We collect and use the IMEI number
              with your explicit consent, obtained during device setup or
              registration.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Security Measures:</strong></p>
            <p>
              <strong>Data Protection:</strong> The IMEI number is securely stored
              on Google Cloud with encryption and limited access to prevent
              unauthorized use.
            </p>
  
            <h3>2.3 SMS Service</h3>
            <p><strong>Collection and Purpose:</strong></p>
            <p>
              <strong>Verification and Communication:</strong> We use SMS to send
              verification codes, notifications, and updates related to the app,
              including One-Time Passwords (OTPs) and important alerts. This
              service is used only to the extent you have consented to receive
              such communications.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Security Measures:</strong></p>
            <p>
              <strong>Secure Handling:</strong> While SMS transmission itself is
              not encrypted, we ensure that any sensitive data related to SMS
              services is handled securely and in compliance with applicable
              privacy laws.
            </p>

            </p>
  
            <h3>7. Data Retention</h3>

            <h3>8. Your Data Rights</h3>
            <p>
              As you may know, a European Union law called the General Data
              Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) gives certain rights to applicable
              individuals in relation to their personal data. Accordingly, we have
              implemented transparency and access controls to help such users,
              including residents of the EU, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom
              exercise those rights.
            </p>

              request, ADEEVA TECHNOLOGIES PVT .LTD will permanently and irrevocably anonymize your
              data such that it can never be reconstructed to identify you as an
              individual. However, this is not an absolute right and ADEEVA TECHNOLOGIES PVT .LTD

              format, and you have the right to transmit those data to another
              controller without hindrance from us. This right only applies when
              the processing of your personal data is based on your consent or on
              a contract and such processing is carried out by automated means.
            </p>

              to object at any time, on grounds relating to your particular
              situation, to processing of personal data concerning you when such

              may, however, invoke compelling legitimate grounds for
              continued processing. When your personal data is processed for
              direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time
              to the processing of such data. You may, in particular, exercise
